#### Writing this Python Code to read the 180 file and concating
import os
import glob
import pandas as pd

# Define the path to the Downloads folder
downloads_folder = os.path.expanduser('~/Downloads')
print(downloads_folder)

# Create a pattern to match files starting with 'driver_details_2W'
pattern = os.path.join(downloads_folder, 'driver_details_2W*.csv')
print(pattern)

# Use glob to find all matching CSV files
files = glob.glob(pattern)

# Initialize an empty list to hold the DataFrames
dataframes = []

# Read each file and append the DataFrame to the list
for file in files:
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    print(df.head(1))
    dataframes.append(df)

# Concatenate all DataFrames into a single DataFrame
combined_df = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True)

# Optionally, save the combined DataFrame to a new CSV file
combined_df.to_csv(os.path.join(downloads_folder, 'combined_driver_details.csv'), index=False)

print("Concatenation complete. Combined DataFrame shape:", combined_df.shape)




Let's break down your code like you're explaining it to someone who's 9!

---

### **What's happening here?**

Youâ€™re collecting **a bunch of files** from your **Downloads** folder that all start with `driver_details_2W`. These are like puzzle pieces, and your code puts them together into **one big table** (a DataFrame).

---

### **Step by Step:**

1. **Find where your Downloads folder is:**
   ```python
   downloads_folder = os.path.expanduser('~/Downloads')
   print(downloads_folder)
   ```
   This makes the computer figure out where your Downloads folder is, no matter which computer youâ€™re using.

2. **Look for files with a special name:**
   ```python
   pattern = os.path.join(downloads_folder, 'driver_details_2W*.csv')
   print(pattern)
   ```
   Here, youâ€™re telling the computer: *"Look for files in the Downloads folder that start with `driver_details_2W` and end with `.csv`."*

3. **Find all the matching files:**
   ```python
   files = glob.glob(pattern)
   ```
   This gathers a list of all the files that match, like:
   ```
   ['driver_details_2W1.csv', 'driver_details_2W2.csv', ...]
   ```

4. **Read the files one by one:**
   ```python
   for file in files:
       df = pd.read_csv(file)
       print(df.head(1))
       dataframes.append(df)
   ```
   - **`pd.read_csv(file)`**: This opens one file and turns it into a **mini table** (DataFrame).
   - **`df.head(1)`**: Shows the **first row** of the mini table, just to check if everythingâ€™s okay.
   - **`dataframes.append(df)`**: Adds this mini table to a list, like collecting puzzle pieces.

5. **Stick all the tables together:**
   ```python
   combined_df = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True)
   ```
   This combines all the mini tables into **one giant table**! ðŸŽ‰

6. **(Optional) Save the big table:**
   ```python
   combined_df.to_csv(os.path.join(downloads_folder, 'combined_driver_details.csv'), index=False)
   ```
   If you want, you can save the giant table as a new file, so itâ€™s easier to share or use later.

7. **Check how big the table is:**
   ```python
   print("Concatenation complete. Combined DataFrame shape:", combined_df.shape)
   ```
   This tells you how many rows and columns your giant table has. For example:
   ```
   Concatenation complete. Combined DataFrame shape: (5000, 6)
   ```
   Means 5,000 rows (like records) and 6 columns (categories).

### **Why is this useful?**
- If you have **a lot of files** with similar data, this code saves you from opening each one manually.
- You get **all your data in one place**, ready to analyze.

Does this make sense? ðŸ˜Š
